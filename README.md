# spring-boot
This is a spring-boot demo. 
This project show you how to use spring boot build a web application(WITHOUT xml, tomcat). I try to use AOP in spring boot there is not difference between spring-boot and orginal spring.
You can run main method in SimpleController and access <http://localhost:8080/hello/> . It is so simpleness so no more to say ;)
